## Description
    I built a simple API  that takes in Users, their thoughts which are attached to each user, and reactions to each thought that are attached to each thought.  Using Mongodb, Mongoose, express and a handfull of other packages, the API allows users to add , edit and delete information on the backend.
    
    
## Installation
    Open the terminal by right-clicking the "server.js" file and clicking "open in integrated terminal"
    
## Usage
    Free to use for your own projects! (if you want??)
    
## License

## Contributing
    Just me, I'm the only contributor.

    After opening in the terminal, run "npm i" to install any dependencies. Afterwards, run "nodemon server.js" to run the server live on your machine.
